## 📨 Sample Email Analyzed
A fake breach notification email pretending to be from **Capital One**. The email claims that the user’s account has been suspended due to profile changes and urges them to verify their information using embedded links.

## 🔍 Key Phishing Indicators Identified

- 🚩 **Fake Sender Domain**: `Captialone@update-win.com` is not an official Capital One email address.
- 🕵️ **Brand Impersonation**: Logo and layout mimic Capital One to build trust.
- ⛔ **Urgency and Fear Tactics**: Claims account is suspended and urges immediate action.
- 🔗 **Suspicious Links**: Fake links like “Review your current staus online” intended to harvest credentials.
- ✍️ **Spelling Errors**: Misspelling of “status” as “staus” reveals lack of professionalism.
- 📩 **Generic Content**: No personalization or user-specific info.
- ❌ **No Legal Footer**: Real financial institution emails contain proper disclaimers, terms, and contact info.
